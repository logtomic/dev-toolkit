# Dev-Toolkit
An **in-progress** overview of the tools I use for development. Will be merging with my dotfiles repo once I'm happy with it.
## Shell
### nushell: https://www.nushell.sh/
My new favorite shell. Currently not advised to set as default, so for now I'm using it as a tool for specific tasks. Zsh is still my default shell.

## Package Manager
### Cargo: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
I'm using cargo to install most of my tools. It just so happens to also install rust, which is my current addiction anyways.

## Prompt
### Starship: https://starship.rs/
My all-time favorite way to customize my prompt. Configuration can be found in `dotfiles/starship.toml`.

## Packages
### ripgrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
A really nice grep alternative.

### navi: https://github.com/denisidoro/navi
A *very* helpful cheatsheet tool. Commands can be found in the `cheats` directory.

### lsd: https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd
A nice alternative to `ls`.

### bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
A nice alternative to `cat`.

### zellij: https://zellij.dev/
A terminal multiplexer. I'm using it as a replacement for `tmux`.

### lazygit: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit
A nice terminal-based git UI.

### mprocs: https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs
A nice terminal-based multi-process viewer.
